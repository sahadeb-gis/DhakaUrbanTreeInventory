# DhakaUrbanTreeInventory
This repository contains R codes used for the Urban Tree Inventory of Dhaka. As the lead of the technical team, I contributed to developing the analytical framework, data collection, preparation, and analysis phases. The files include scripts for both data preparation and analysis using the i-Tree platform.
